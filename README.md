# AWS .NET Configuration Extension for Systems Manager
[![nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager/)

[Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager/) simplifies using [AWS SSM](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)'s [Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html) as a source for configuration information for .NET Core applications.  This project was contributed by [@KenHundley](https://github.com/KenHundley).

The library introduces the following dependencies:

* [AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup/)
* [AWSSDK.SimpleSystemsManagement](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AWSSDK.SimpleSystemsManagement/)
* [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration)

# Getting Started

Follow the examples below to see how the library can be integrated into your application.  This extension adheres to the same practices and conventions of [Configuration in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.1).

## ASP.NET Core Example
The most common use case for this library is to pull configuration from Parameter Store.  You can easily add this functionality by adding 1 line of code:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration(builder =>
            {
                builder.AddSystemsManager("/my-application/");
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
}
```

## HostBuilder Example
Microsoft introduced [.NET Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-2.1) to de-couple HTTP pipeline from the Web Host API.  The Generic Host library allows you to write non-HTTP services using configuration, dependency injection, and logging features.  The sample code below shows you how to use the the AWS .NET Configuration Extension library:

```csharp
namespace HostBuilderExample
{
    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var host = new HostBuilder()
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
            {
                config.AddSystemsManager("/my-application/");
            })
            .ConfigureServices((sc) => { ... })
            .Build();

        await host.RunAsync();
    }
}
```

# Reloading in AWS Lambda

The `reloadAfter` parameter on `AddSystemsManager()` enables automatic reloading of configuration data from Parameter Store as a background task.

In AWS Lambda, background tasks are paused after processing a Lambda event.  This could disrupt the provider from 
retrieving the latest configuration data from Parameter Store. To ensure the reload is performed within a Lambda event,
we recommend calling the extension method `WaitForSystemsManagerReloadToComplete` from the `IConfiguration` object in 
your Lambda function. This method will immediately return unless a reload is currently being performed.  The `WaitForSystemsManagerReloadToComplete` extension method to `IConfiguration` is available when you add the a
`using Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager` statement.  See the example below:


```csharp
using Amazon.Extensions.Configuration.SystemsManager

...

var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
configurationBuilder.AddSystemsManager(IntegTestFixture.ParameterPrefix, fixture.AWSOptions);
var configurations = configurationBuilder.Build();

...

configurations.WaitForSystemsManagerReloadToComplete(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
```
